### What I learned

I learned how to use the @layer rule. It helped me make the index.css file more organized.


### Useful resources

- [https://clamp.font-size.app/](https://clamp.font-size.app/) - Pretty convenient for generating clamps. It's meant for font-size, but I use it for other stuff too like gaps, margins, etc.
